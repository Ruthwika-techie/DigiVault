1.Project Overview:
DigiVault is a smart digital document-management Android application designed to help users securely store their important documents and get timely reminders before they expire.
Instead of manually remembering renewal dates for IDs, certificates, insurance papers, or vehicle-related documents, DigiVault automates the entire process.
The app ensures that users never miss a deadline and stay organized effortlessly.

2.Purpose of the Application:
People often forget critical expiry dates:
 Driving license renewal
 Aadhaar/PAN updates
 Insurance renewals
 ID card validity
 Academic certificates
 Travel documents
Missing these dates can cause fines, delays, or inconvenience. DigiVault solves this problem by acting as a digital “assistant” that tracks dates and sends reminders at the right time.
The primary objective is organization, safety, and proactive reminders.

5.WHAT MAKES THIS APP UNIQUE FROM EXISTING ONE'S ?
  What makes DigiVault+ different is that it’s not just another app to store documents. Anyone can upload files in Google Drive or their phone gallery — that part is nothing new. 
  The real problem people face is forgetting when those documents expire.That’s the gap we focused on.
  DigiVault+ works more like a small helper that keeps an eye on all your expiry dates and reminds you before something runs out.
  Whether it’s a license, an ID card, an insurance paper, or even a college document, the app makes sure you don’t miss the renewal date. 
  This simple idea solves a real headache everyone deals with, but most apps ignore.
  Another thing that makes it unique is that everything works offline. Your documents stay on your phone, so there’s no worry about privacy or internet. 
  The app is clean, light, and made for normal people who just want something easy to use without too many steps.
  We didn’t try to add unnecessary complex features. Instead, we built something practical that actually fits into daily life. 
  That’s why DigiVault+ stands out — it focuses on one common problem and solves it in a clean, simple, and reliable way.
