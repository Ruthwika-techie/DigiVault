# DigiVault
DigiVault is a secure digital locker that stores and organizes important documents in one place, making them easy to access anytime while keeping them safe.The main purpose of DigiVault is to eliminate the need for physical files and scattered digital folders. Instead of searching across devices or worrying about losing important documents, users can keep everything stored securely within the app. DigiVault ensures privacy through safe login authentication and protected storage mechanisms that prevent unauthorized access.
# Problem Statement
Today everyone handles many important documents: driving license, Aadhaar/PAN, insurance papers, college certificates, vehicle documents, travel documents, resumes, scholarship forms, interview schedules, etc.
The issue is not storing these documents. Anyone can keep them in Google Drive or their phone gallery.
The real problem is:
- forgetting expiry dates
- missing renewals
- paying fines because something expired
- losing track of interview or scholarship dates
- documents being scattered everywhere
- needing a document urgently when there is no internet
Most apps store files, but they don’t solve the main difficulty: reminding users at the right time and helping them stay organized.
# Idea Description — DigiVault
DigiVault is a simple and smart document-management app designed to help people stay organised. Instead of only storing images or PDFs, the app mainly focuses on tracking expiry dates and reminding the user before something is due.
The app works offline and keeps all files safely on the user’s device. The intention is to build something lightweight and practical for everyday use. No unnecessary complexity, just features that actually solve the problem.
