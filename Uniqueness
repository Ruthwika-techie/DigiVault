🧠 Why DigiVault is Unique
DigiVault isn’t just another file storage app. It’s a personal vault with intelligence:
• 	🗂️ Hybrid Storage Model
Organize documents and cards using folders and subfolders—something apps like DigiLocker or Google Drive don’t offer natively.
• 	🔗 Live Card Linking
Link stored cards (Aadhaar, PAN, insurance) directly to their official websites for real-time updates, renewals, and verification.
• 	🛡️ Emergency Vault Access
Access critical documents offline during emergencies—no internet, no problem.
• 	🧠 Smart Features
• 	Expiry reminders for documents and cards
• 	Tag-based search for quick retrieval
• 	QR-based secure sharing
• 	🏛️ E-Governance Ready
Built with scalable APIs for integration with DigiLocker, UIDAI, mParivahan, and other government platforms.
• 	🌍 Inclusive Design
Multi-language support, accessibility-first UI, and biometric security make it usable for everyone—from urban professionals to rural citizens.

🛠️ Technical Architecture
DigiVault follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for clean separation of concerns:
• 	Model: Uses Room Database to store documents and metadata
• 	View: Android UI screens built with Material Design
• 	ViewModel: Handles business logic, data flow, and background tasks
This structure makes the app easy to maintain, test, and scale.

⚙️ Technology Stack
• 	Language: Kotlin
• 	IDE: Android Studio
• 	Database: Room
• 	Reminders: WorkManager
• 	UI: Material Design Components
• 	Security: AndroidX Biometric Library
• 	Optional Add-ons:
• 	ML Kit OCR for auto-reading expiry dates
• 	CameraX for document scanning

🔄 System Workflow
1. 	User adds a document
→ Enters name, scans/uploads photo, selects expiry date
2. 	Data stored in Room Database
→ Metadata saved in Document table
3. 	WorkManager schedules reminders
→ Based on expiry date
4. 	App shows notifications
→ “Expiring Soon”, “Expired”, “Safe Zone”
5. 	Dashboard updates dynamically                                                                                       App Modules
