DigiVault combines secure document management, smart card integration, government-ready architecture and integration with other identity services into a single, software as a service (SaaS) based solution. Here is what makes it unique about:
• 🗂️ Hybrid Storage Model: DigiVault offers a hybrid storage model unlike DigiLocker or Google Drive with folders and subfolders. This allows users to organize documents and digital cards more intuitively.
• 🔗 Live Card Linking: Any stored card, such as Aadhaar, PAN, or insurance, can be linked to the official card website for real time updates, renewals, and verifications, closing the divide between storage and dynamic services.
• 🛡️ Emergency Vault Access: People can reach important documents through a special offline mode even when they cannot get online.
• 	🧠 Smart Features:
• 	Document and card expiry reminders
• 	Tag-based search for quick retrieval
• 	QR-based secure sharing
• 🏛️ E-Governance Ready: Scalable architecture has APIs. The APIs can integrate with government applications. The applications include DigiLocker, UIDAI, and mParivahan for potential nationwide application.
• 🌍 Inclusive design: With multi-language, accessibility-first, and biometric security features, it is easy to use for all across India and abroad.
